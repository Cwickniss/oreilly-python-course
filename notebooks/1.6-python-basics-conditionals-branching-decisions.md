# Python Conditionals and Decision Making

## Introduction to Control Flow

In programming, we often need to make decisions based on certain conditions. Python provides `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements for this purpose.

## Basic If Statements

```python
time_of_day = 14  # 24-hour format

if time_of_day < 12:
    print("Good morning!")
```

## If-Else Statements

```python
battery_percentage = 15

if battery_percentage < 20:
    print("Warning: Battery low!")
    print("Please connect charger")
else:
    print("Battery level okay")
```

## If-Elif-Else Chains

```python
def check_file_status(file_size_mb):
    if file_size_mb == 0:
        print("Error: File is empty")
    elif file_size_mb < 1:
        print("Warning: File is very small")
    elif file_size_mb > 1000:
        print("Warning: File is very large")
    else:
        print("File size is acceptable")

check_file_status(0.5)
check_file_status(1500)
```

## Comparison Operators

```python
# Common comparison operators
x = 5
y = 10

print(x == y)  # Equal to
print(x != y)  # Not equal to
print(x < y)   # Less than
print(x > y)   # Greater than
print(x <= y)  # Less than or equal to
print(x >= y)  # Greater than or equal to
```

## Logical Operators

```python
cpu_usage = 85
memory_usage = 90

if cpu_usage > 80 and memory_usage > 80:
    print("System under heavy load!")
    print("Consider closing some applications")

files_to_process = ["doc1.txt", "doc2.txt"]
backup_done = False

if not backup_done or len(files_to_process) > 0:
    print("Daily tasks incomplete")
```

## Nested Conditionals

```python
def process_file(filename, size_mb):
    if filename.endswith('.txt'):
        if size_mb < 1:
            print(f"Processing small text file: {filename}")
            return True
        else:
            print(f"Text file too large: {filename}")
            return False
    else:
        print(f"Unsupported file type: {filename}")
        return False

process_file("report.txt", 0.5)
process_file("data.csv", 0.3)
process_file("video.txt", 10)
```

## Conditional Expressions (Ternary Operator)

```python
download_speed = 15  # Mbps

connection_status = "Good" if download_speed >= 10 else "Poor"
print(f"Internet connection: {connection_status}")
```

## Checking Multiple Conditions

```python
def analyze_system_status(cpu_temp, disk_space, updates_pending):
    if cpu_temp >= 80:
        print("WARNING: CPU temperature critical!")
    
    if disk_space < 1000:  # MB
        print("WARNING: Low disk space!")
    
    if updates_pending > 0:
        print(f"INFO: {updates_pending} system updates available")
    
    if cpu_temp < 80 and disk_space >= 1000 and updates_pending == 0:
        print("System status: All good!")

analyze_system_status(85, 500, 3)
analyze_system_status(70, 1500, 0)
```

## Practice Exercise

```python
def automate_backup(file_count, total_size_mb, last_backup_hours):
    """
    Decide if a backup should be performed based on various conditions
    """
    if last_backup_hours > 24:
        print("Backup needed: More than 24 hours since last backup")
        return True
    elif file_count > 100:
        print("Backup needed: Large number of files modified")
        return True
    elif total_size_mb > 500:
        print("Backup needed: Significant data changes")
        return True
    else:
        print("No backup needed at this time")
        return False

# Test cases
automate_backup(50, 100, 25)    # More than 24 hours
automate_backup(150, 200, 5)    # Many files modified
automate_backup(20, 600, 12)    # Large data changes
automate_backup(10, 50, 2)      # No backup needed
```

## Summary
- Conditionals allow programs to make decisions based on conditions
- Basic syntax includes `if`, `elif`, and `else`
- Comparison operators: `==`, `!=`, `<`, `>`, `<=`, `>=`
- Logical operators: `and`, `or`, `not`
- Nested conditionals for complex decision making
- Ternary operator for simple conditional expressions
